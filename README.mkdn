# NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Travis::ConfigForReleaseBranch - Create a `.travis.yml` suitable for built branches

# VERSION

This document describes version 0.005 of Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Travis::ConfigForReleaseBranch - released June 21, 2017 as part of Dist-Zilla-Plugin-Travis-ConfigForReleaseBranch.

# SYNOPSIS

    ; in your dist.ini
    [Travis::ConfigForReleaseBranch]

# DESCRIPTION

This is a simple [Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InlineFiles](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InlineFiles) plugin to include a
sensible -- or so this author believes -- `.travis.yml` suitable for running
[Travis-CI jobs](http://travis-ci.org) off of a release branch like one
generated by the [Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Git::CommitBuild](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Git::CommitBuild)
plugin.

By default, we build against Perl 5.8, 5.10, 5.12, 5.14, 5.16, 5.18, 5.20, and
5.21.  The 5.8 and 5.21 build jobs are allowed to fail without causing the
entire build run to fail.

# EARLY VERSION!

Yep, this is an early, early version.  No tests, and no flexibility in
configuration details.  Anyone wishing to assist (and faster than this author
in remedying this sad, sad state of affairs) is more than welcome to submit
pull requests.  Good pull requests are likely to earn the undying gratitude of
this humble CPAN author.
